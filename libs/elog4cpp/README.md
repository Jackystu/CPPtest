`elog4cpp` : means that this is a very `easy` to use and very `efficient` in performance c++ logging library. It supports c++11 and above, and is fully cross-platform.

The use of `easy` is reflected in:
* Simple api, you only need to focus on an `elog::Log` class, or static method `Log::<LEVEL>`, or macro definition `ELG_<LEVEL>`.
* Formatting output is simple because the [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library is used for formatting output.
* Custom formatting is simple because custom `formatter` is supported, and four `formatters` are preconfigured, including defaultFormatter, colorfulFormatter, jsonFormatter, and customFormatter.
* Easy to configure, supports reading configuration items via `json` file with one click.
* Easy to introduce, support `cmake` command to introduce and use the project with one click.

Performance `efficiency` is reflected in:

* The latency of outputting a log is only `180ns` synchronously and `120ns` asynchronously, which is at least 4 times the performance of spdlog.

For benchmark, see [tests/bench_start.cc](https://github.com/ACking-you/elog4cpp/blob/master/tests/bench_start.cc)

## Quick Start

### Requirements

* C++11 and above, which is cross-platform

### Installation and Introduction

The following two methods are recommended for introduction.

* Method 1: Introduce via the `FetchContent` module in cmake.
    1. add the following code to the project cmake to introduce, domestic if the network problems can not use this gitee image source: https://gitee.com/acking-you/elog4cpp.git
        ```cmake
        include(FetchContent)
  
        FetchContent_Declare(
                elog4cpp
                GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/ACking-you/elog4cpp.git
                GIT_TAG origin/fetch
                GIT_SHALLOW TRUE)
        FetchContent_MakeAvailable(elog4cpp)
        ````
    2. Link `elog` in the target that needs to use the library.
        ```cmake
        target_link_libraries(target elog)
        ```
* Method 2: Download the source code manually and then introduce it via the cmake command.

    1. download the project source code via the git command

        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/ACking-you/elog4cpp.git --recursive
        ````

    2. Add the project to a subproject.

       ```cmake
       add_subdirectory(elog4cpp)
       ```

    3. Link `elog` in the target that needs to use the library.

       ```cmake
       target_link_libraries(target elog)
       ```

### Getting Started

* Without any configuration, we can directly call the static method output to the terminal with the following code.

    ```cpp
    #include <elog/logger.h>
    using namespace elog;
    
    int main()
    {
        Log::trace("hello elog4cpp");
        Log::debug("hello elog4cpp");
        Log::info("hello elog4cpp");
        Log::warn("hello elog4cpp");
        Log::error("hello elog4cpp");
        Log::fatal("hello elog4cpp");
    }
    ```
  The output is as follows.
  ![output](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/15ddda1c5a184e61b54afa83b33dcaa2.png)
  Through the above example, we need to understand the following three points.
    1. The output levels of this log library are `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. 
    2. The default output level is `debug`, which means that the `trace` level is not output.
    3. The `fatal` level of output will throw an exception.

  > In fact, if there is an error in `errno` at the `error` or `fatal` level of output, then the corresponding error will be output, which is useful some time.
---

* In the previous example, we were unable to output the log at `trace` level, now we try to change its minimum output level and then add more information to the output (such as file name, line number, function name, etc.) and output the output in color highlighting.

  The code is as follows:

    ```cpp
    #include <elog/logger.h>
    using namespace elog;
    
    int main()
    {
        GlobalConfig::Get()
            .setLevel(Levels::kTrace)
            .setFormatter(formatter::colorfulFormatter);
        Log::trace(loc::current(), "hello elog4cpp");
        Log::debug(loc::current(), "hello elog4cpp");
        Log::info(loc::current(), "hello elog4cpp");
        Log::warn(loc::current(), "hello elog4cpp");
        Log::error(loc::current(), "hello elog4cpp");
    }
    ```
  The output looks like this:
  ![img2](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/ba02536932f54116a73c74006b6587bf.png)
  From the above example code, we found that if we need to get information such as file name, we need to pass `loc::current()` in the first parameter, obviously most of the time we will find it troublesome to use this, so we can solve this problem through macros, you can do like the following, before introducing `<elog/logger.h>` define ` ENABLE_ELG_LOG` macro before introducing `<ELG_<LEVEL>` to use the shorter macro definition `ELG_<LEVEL>`.
  ```cpp
  #define ENABLE_ELG_LOG
  #include <elog/logger.h>
  using namespace elog;

  int main()
  {
  GlobalConfig::Get()
    .setLevel(Levels::kTrace)
    .setFormatter(formatter::colorfulFormatter);
  ELG_TRACE("hello elog4cpp");
  ELG_DEBUG("hello elog4cpp");
  ELG_INFO("hello elog4cpp");
  ELG_WARN("hello elog4cpp");
  ELG_ERROR("hello elog4cpp");
  }
  ```
  The code generated by this macro definition is equivalent to the code in the previous example.
---

* The previous examples all just output to the console, we now output the content to a file.
  The code is as follows:
    ```cpp
    #define ENABLE_ELG_LOG
    #include <elog/logger.h>
    using namespace elog;
    
    int main()
    {
        GlobalConfig::Get()
            .setFilepath(". /log/")
            .setLevel(Levels::kTrace)
            .setFormatter(formatter::colorfulFormatter);
        ELG_TRACE("hello elog4cpp");
        ELG_DEBUG("hello elog4cpp");
        ELG_INFO("hello elog4cpp");
        ELG_WARN("hello elog4cpp");
        ELG_ERROR("hello elog4cpp");
    }
    ```

  The output of the above code is output both to the file and to the console, `setFilepath(". /log/")` specifies that the output file is in the `log` folder at the next level. Note that the file path passed here can only be the output file's folder path, meaning that file output only supports scrolling logs. If the parameter is changed to `". /log"` then the output folder path is the parent directory, and the output file names are prefixed with `log`. The output folder is named in the following format: `.<DATE TIME>.<USERNAME>.<PID>.log`.If you want to disable output to the console, just add the following configuration:`GlobalConfig::Get().enableConsole(false)`. Similarly, if you don't need to output to a file, you need to keep `log_filepath` at the default value of `nullptr`. 

After the above three practices, you should have understood the basic use of this library, and if you need to understand the corresponding use in detail, you can continue to learn more about the following contents.

1. [How to configure](#how-to-configure)
2. [Detailed interface description](#detailed-interface-description)


## How to configure

All configurations are based on the `Config` class or the `GlobalConfig` class. Note the relationship between these two classes, the `Config` class acts as a base class for `GlobalConfig`, `Config` contains some output generic configuration, which is generally used for local configuration, and `GlobalConfig` contains some special one-time configuration, which is generally used as a global singleton for global configuration.

### Global configuration

If no local configuration is set, the global configuration is used by default. If you are using static methods or macros for log printing, then you can only use configuration via global configuration.

#### Configuration methods

All global configurations are configured through a global singleton `GlobalConfig`, which can be obtained by calling `GlobalConfig::Get`.

1. call the methods of `GlobalConfig` to configure it, as follows.

   The special methods are as follows:
    * `GlobalConfig::setRollSize(int size)`: Sets the maximum size over which a single file will create a new file for log printing, with mb as the base unit.
    * `GlobalConfig::setFlushInterval(int flushinterval)`: Sets how often to flush the log to disk, in seconds.
    * `GlobalConfig::setFilepath(const char* basedir)`: set the output path of the scrolling log, note that the path passed in is not a single file path, but a folder path, this log library only supports scrolling log.
    * `GlobalConfig::enableConsole(bool s)`: set whether to output to console.
   
    The methods inherited from `config` are as follows:
    * `Config::setFlag(Flags flag)`: Sets flags, which can be used to control the content of the log output in a more fine-grained way, for flags there are the following enumerations.
        * `kDate`: whether to output the date.
        * `kTime`: whether to output the time.
        * `kLongname`: whether to output long file names.
        * `kShortname`: whether to output short file names.
        * `kLine`: whether output the line number.
        * `kFuncName`: whether output the function name.
        * `kThreadId`: whether output the thread id.
        * `kStdFlags`: represents `kDate | kTime | kShortname | kLine | kFuncName`, the or operation inside means the corresponding function is enabled.
    * `Config::setLevel(Levels level)`: set the minimum log output level.
    * `Config::setName(const char* name)`: Set the name of the logger, which will be added to the output.
    * `Config::setBefore(callback_t const& cb)`: Sets the callback function that occurs before formatting.
    * `Config::setAfter(callback_t const& cb)`: Sets the callback function that occurs after formatting.
    * `Config::setFormatter(formatter_t const& formatter)`: Sets the formatter, which is already written by default as follows.
        * `defaultFormatter` : The default formatter.
        * `colorfulFormatter`: bring color to the output of the console desk, based on the default formatter.
        * `jsonFormatter` : Output in json format.
        * `customFromString(str) -> formatter_t`: This is a custom formatter that you can get from the string you pass in, please see the subsequent description for details on how to use it.
2. configure by passing in the json configuration file, the details are as follows.
   The key methods are `loadFromJSON` and `loadToJSON`, which are used to read information from the json file to set the variable value of `GlobalConfig` and invert the value of `GlobalConfig` according to the value of the variable. to generate the corresponding json file.
   The specific `json` configuration file is as follows, and all usage is described in the `comments`.

   ```json
   {
     "comments": [
       "The following values are all comments generated by default to explain the considerations for filling in the parameters",
       "name:optional parameter, if not filled by default, the log output will have no name",
       "roll_size: the threshold value for rolling the log, in mb",
       "flush_interval: the time in seconds to flush the log background",
       "out_console: whether to turn on the output console, is bool value",
       "out_file: if or not to turn on the output log file, use null value if not, use a folder directory if you turn on",
       "flag: used to turn on the log corresponding to the output data content, there are date, time, line, file, short_file, tid, func seven, can be turned on at the same time through the + sign, of course, you can also directly use default, which indicates that all options other than tid",
       "level:used to specify the global minimum output level, there are trace,debug,info,warn,error,fatal, the default use debug",
       "format: used to specify the global log formatting, there are default, colorful, custom three, the default take default, if you use custom, you need to add fmt_string",
       "fmt_string: only when the formatter select custom used to set the custom formatter, the corresponding data is expressed as follows: %T:time,%t:tid,%F:filepath,%f:func,%e:error info,%L:long levelText,%l: short levelText,%v:message ,%c color start %C color end"
     ],
     "elog": {
       "flag": "default",
       "flush_interval": 3,
       "formatter": "default",
       "level": "debug",
       "out_console": true,
       "out_file": "null",
       "roll_size": 20
     }
   }
   ```

#### Example of using 

Two simple and complete usage examples are as follows.

1. configuration via the `GlobalConfig` method.

   ```cpp
   #define ENABLE_ELG_LOG
   #include <elog/logger.h>
   using namespace elog;

   int main()
   {
    GlobalConfig::Get()
        .setRollSize(4)
        .setFlushInterval(3)
        .setFilepath(". /log/")
        .enableConsole(true)
        .setFlag(kStdFlags + kThreadId)
        .setLevel(kTrace)
        .setName("elog")
        .setBefore([](output_buf_t& buf) {
            buf.append("before");
	    })
        .setAfter([](output_buf_t& buf) {
            buf.append("after");
        })
        .setFormatter(formatter::customFromString("%c[%L][%T][tid:%t][name:%n][file:%F][func:%f]:%v%C"));
    ELG_TRACE("hello elog4cpp");
    ELG_DEBUG("hello elog4cpp");
    ELG_INFO("hello elog4cpp");
    ELG_WARN("hello elog4cpp");
    ELG_ERROR("hello elog4cpp");
   }
   ```
   The printed result is as follows:
   ![img2](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/39e4711a3dd0428a903a4120710d31e2.png)

2. Similarly, you can directly load the corresponding configuration items using the equivalent `json` configuration file.
  
   The configuration items are as follows:
   ```cpp
   {
     "elog": {
       "flag": "default+tid",
       "flush_interval": 3,
       "name": "elog",
       "formatter": "custom",
       "fmt_string": "%c[%L][%T][tid:%t][name:%n][file:%F][func:%f]:%v%C",
       "level": "trace",
       "out_console": true,
       "out_file": ". /log/",
       "roll_size": 4
     }
   }
   ```

   The code is as follows:
   ```cpp
   #define ENABLE_ELG_LOG
   #include <elog/logger.h>
   using namespace elog;
   
   int main()
   {
   	GlobalConfig::Get()
   		.loadFromJSON(". /config.json")
   		.setBefore([](output_buf_t& buf) {
   			buf.append("before");
   		})
   		.setAfter([](output_buf_t& buf) {
   			buf.append("after");
   		});
   	ELG_TRACE("hello elog4cpp");
   	ELG_DEBUG("hello elog4cpp");
   	ELG_INFO("hello elog4cpp");
   	ELG_WARN("hello elog4cpp");
   	ELG_ERROR("hello elog4cpp");
   }
   ```

### Local configuration

A local configuration means that a separate `Config` configuration can be used by creating a separate class. Some configurations are only available globally, specifically `roolSize`, `flushInterval`, `outConsole`, `outFile`, and because the thread responsible for output on the backend can only be a single instance, these configurations can also only be configured once.

The steps on how to use the local configuration are as follows.

1. Through `Log::registerConfigByName` into your custom `Config`.
2. Create a `Log` using the configuration with the `Config` name you inject.
3. Using the `Log` object, call its corresponding `println` and `printf` methods to print.

The sample code is as follows.

```cpp
#include <elog/logger.h>
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
using namespace elog;

void config_global()
{
	GlobalConfig::Get()
		.loadFromJSON(". /config.json")
		.setBefore([](output_buf_t& buf) {
			buf.append("before");
		})
		.setAfter([](output_buf_t& buf) {
			buf.append("after");
		});
}

void register_local_config()
{
	auto config = make_unique<Config>();
	config->log_formatter = formatter::colorfulFormatter;
	config->log_name = "local_config";
	config->log_level = kTrace;
	config->log_flag = kStdFlags + kThreadId;
	config->log_before = [](output_buf_t& buf) {
		buf.append("before");
	};
	config->log_after = [](output_buf_t& buf) {
		buf.append("after");
	};
	// Register Config
	Log::registerConfigByName("local_config",std::move(config));
}

int main()
{
	config_global();
    register_local_config();
	// Create Log object and set the corresponding Config and level
	auto trace = Log(kTrace, "local_config");
	trace.printf("hello {}", "world");
	trace.println("hello", std::vector<int>{1, 2, 32});
	//Change the log output level
	trace.set_level(kDebug);
	trace.printf("hello {}", "world");
	trace.println("hello", std::vector<int>{1, 2, 32});
	//Can be safely copied to continue to use
	auto info = trace;
	info.set_level(kInfo);
	info.printf("hello {}", "world");
	info.println("hello", std::vector<int>{1, 2, 32});
}
```
> Note: Registering Config is not thread-safe, make sure you complete the registration of Config before logging out.

## Detailed interface description

### Formatter

#### Built-in formatter

If you have read the previous section, then you should have some idea about the role of `formatter`, which is an interface implementation for controlling formatted output.

* `defaultFormatter`: This is the default formatter, with a fixed format.
* `jsonFormatter` : This is the default formatter with a fixed format.
* `colorfulFormatter`: The output is in the same format as the formatter, but with color highlighting when output to the console.
* `customFromString`: can customize the output format according to the string passed in by the user.
  Specific description.
    * %T: indicates the whole date and time, also includes the time zone.
    * %t: indicates the thread id.
    * %F: indicates which file the log output comes from.
    * %f: indicates which function the log output came from.
    * %e: indicates the error message if there is an error in `errno`, otherwise it is empty.
    * %n: indicates the name of the current logger, or null if it does not exist.
    * %L: indicates a long string representing the logging level, such as `TRACE`.
    * %l: indicates a short string representing the log level, such as `TRC`.
    * %v: indicates the content of the log output.
    * %c and %C: indicates the start and end of the color, valid only in terminals that support `\033`.

#### Custom formatter

Since you want `formatter`, it is important to be clear about what exactly `formatter` is designed to do in this log library. In fact, `formatter` is simply a callback function in this log library, with the following function signature.

```cpp
using formatter_t = std::function<void(Config* config, context const& ctx, buffer_t&buf,Appenders apender_type)>;
```

The meaning of each parameter is as follows.

* ``config``: The current configuration used for log output.
* ``ctx``: the content of the current log output, including the contents of the log to be output, the log level and line number, and other information.
* `buf`: the `buffer` that the current log will be output to after final formatting.
* `appder_type`: this is an enumeration representing the destination of the current log formatted output, specifically either file or console.

Based on the above explanation, if you want to implement a `formatter` of your own, you can customize the formatted output to `buffer` by using the configuration information of `config` and the output information of `ctx` and the destination information of `appender_type`.

With the above understanding, we can implement our own `formatter` by looking at the already implemented `formatter`, for example, the source code link for `defaultFormatter` is as follows: [src/formatter.cc](https://github.com/ACking-you/elog4cpp/blob/master/src/formatter.cc)

### Micros

#### ENABLE_ELG_LOG

In order to make the output of file location information without manually adding the `loc::current()` parameter, the log library provides `ELG_<LEVEL>` to simplify this process, so if file location information is needed you can replace `Log::<Level>` with the following macro.

* ELG_TRACE
* ELG_DEBUG
* ELG_INFO
* ELG_WARN
* ELG_ERROR
* ELG_FATAL

> Note: Before using the above macro, you need to define the `ENABLE_ELG_LOG` macro before `#include<elog/logger.h>`.

#### ENABLE_ELG_CHECK

By defining the `ENABLE_ELG_CHECK` macro, we can use the following macro definitions to more easily check the relationship between values.
* Assertion macro that throws an exception if the condition is not met.
    * `ELG_CHECK_EQ(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a == b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_NQ(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a != b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_GE(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a > b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_GT(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a >= b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_LE(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a < b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_LT(a,b)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a <= b)`.
    * `ELG_CHECK_NOTNULL(a)` is equivalent to `ELG_ASSERT_IF(a != nullptr)`.
* Judgment assertion, custom printing.
  After passing in the judgment condition, an object will be returned for you to print the prompt message, and you can choose different levels to print, such as the following example to print the `trace` level.
   ```cpp
   ELG_CHECK(1 == 2).trace("1 != 2");
   ```

### Other util

There are also the following functions that provide convenience.
* `elog::Ptr`: Used to force arbitrary pointers to `void*`, this is to facilitate printing the value of the pointer directly.
* `elog::WaitForDone`: waits for a background thread to flush log information to disk, which is useful at times.
